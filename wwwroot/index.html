    <h1>OCD - Obsessive Cow Disorder</h1>
    <p>Obsessive Cow Disorder, or OCD, is a lighthearted 
    term used to describe an intense admiration for cows. 
    Whether it’s their gentle nature, iconic black-and-white 
    patterns, or the simple joy of seeing them in a pasture, 
    those with OCD find themselves drawn to all things bovine.
    This fascination often extends beyond just an 
    appreciation—it can influence hobbies, décor choices, and 
    even lifestyle decisions. While not a medical condition, 
    OCD is a fun way for cow enthusiasts to embrace their 
    passion and connect with others who share the same love 
    for these incredible animals.</p>

    sometimes feel chaotic, having something to love and 
    appreciate brings connection and positivity. Rather than 
    seeing it as a quirky obsession, OCD should be celebrated 
    as a unique strength that makes life more fun and 
    meaningful.</p>
